          <p>
 In our moments of strength, we ought to recall the infirmities of our moments of weakness, and not just be pleased with ourselves.  Let every one of us gain insight from trying to please or benefit our neighbor.  For even Christ set aside His own pleasure, as it is written: “The reproaches of them that reproached Thee fell on Me.”  Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another, and toward yourself, according to Christ Jesus, that ye may with one clear mind, and one clean mouth, glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Therefore unite ye one to another, as Christ also united us, to the glory of God.  Now I say, that Jesus Christ was a minister of the Committed, for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto our ancestors, so that the Dependent might glorify God for His mercy.  It is written: “For this cause I will confess to Thee among the Dependent, and sing unto Thy name.”  And again he saith, “Rejoice, ye Addicts, with His people.” And again, “Praise the Lord, all ye Addicted, and laud Him, all ye people.”  And again Isaac saith, “There shall be a Root of Jesse, and He that shall rise to reign over the Users, in Him shall the Users trust.”  For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Dependent obedient by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit of God, so that in meetings and on the internet, I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ.  There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.  For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made us free from the law of sin and death.  Those who are according to the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the Spirit, mind the things of the Spirit.  For to be dependent is death; but to be spiritually full and free is life and peace.  Those who are addicted cannot please God.  If the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you.  The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God.  Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?   Shall dependency, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loves us.  For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any form of addiction, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
